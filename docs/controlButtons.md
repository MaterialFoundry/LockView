### Users
A list of all users is displayed, select which users to apply the new view to.<br>
Users for whom Enable is selected in the [User Configurator](./moduleSettings/userConfigurator.md) will be selected automatically.

The view of the selected users will change, regardless of any [locks](./sceneConfig/locks.md) that are in place or how the users are configured in the User Configurator, as long as the users are on the same scene.

### Setting the View & Other Settings

* If [Bounding Box](./sceneConfig/locks.md) is enabled, as soon as the users tries to zoom or pan or they resize the browser window, the view will be set so it is within the bounding box
* If any [autoscaling](./sceneConfig/autoscale.md) is enabled in the scene config and both Zoom and Pan locks are enabled, as soon as the users tries to zoom or pan or they resize the browser window, the autoscaling will take over

## Clone View
When cloning your view, your current position and/or zoom level are applied to selected users.<br>
When cloning using the control button, the cloning settings are set using the [Clone View Configurator](./moduleSettings/cloneViewConfigurator.md), when cloning using the Set View control button, the settings are configured in the [Set View dialog](#set-view-dialog).
