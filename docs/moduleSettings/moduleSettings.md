You can configure Lock View in the module settings.<br>
Some settings are available to all users, some are available to Control users, and some are available to gamemasters.

| Setting    | Type     | Access    | Description   |
|------------|----------|-----------|---------------|
| Documentation | Button    | Everyone  | Opens this documentation.  |
| User Configurator     | Button    | Gamemaster    | Opens the [User Configurator](./userConfigurator.md).    |
| Scene Configurator    | Button    | Gamemaster    | Opens the [Scene Configurator](./sceneConfigurator.md).    |
| Clone View Configurator   | Button    | Control users | Opens the [Clone View Configurator](./cloneViewConfigurator.md). |
| Control Buttons Configurator  | Button    | Control users | Opens the [Control Buttons Configurator](./controlButtonsConfigurator.md).   |
| Mouse Viewbox Editing    | Checkbox  | Gamemaster | When this setting and [Edit Viewbox](../viewbox.md#edit-viewbox) is enabled, scrolling and right-click dragging the mouse will change the view of the viewbox' user instead of yours. |
| Pan Canvas to Ping Behavior   | Select    | Gamemaster | When using Pan Canvas to Ping (shift + hold left mouse button), all users normally pan to that spot. However, since Lock View can lock pan and zoom, you can control whether these locks should apply:<br><b>-Prevent All Locked Movement</b>: Do not allow zooming or panning if their respective lock is enabled.<br><b>-Allow Panning, Prevent Zooming</b>: Do not allow zooming if Zoom Lock is enabled.<br><b>-Allow Zooming, Prevent Panning</b>: Do not allow panning if Pan Lock is enabled.<br><b>Allow All Movement</b>: Do not prevent any movement, regardless of how the locks are configured. |
| Physical Grid Size | Number | Everyone/Gamemaster | Sets the physical dimensions of your display for [Physical Grid Size autoscaling](../sceneConfig/autoscale.md#physical-grid-size).<br><b>-Display Width</b>: The width of the display (not the diagonal). To measure it, use the active part of the display, so the part that actually displays a picture, not the bezel.<br><b>-Grid Size</b>: The desired size of each grid space.<br><b>-Force GM-Set Settings</b>: By default, these settings are local, which means that they can be different for each connected client/user. Enable this to force the GM's settings for all users.<br><br>Both the Display Width and Grid Size can be set in any unit (millimeter, inches), but both must be measured in the same unit (so both in millimeter, or both in inches). |
