# Changelog

### v2.0.1 - 24-06-2025

Fixes:
* Fixed issue where user settings would not correctly return their value under certain circumstances. If, for example, 'Enable' was set to false, it would return the default 'Enable' setting instead of false. This could cause settings being enabled for users for which they should've been disabled.
* Fixed viewbox showing on wrong scene.
* Fixed viewbox not correctly being removed when a user logs off.

### v2.0.0 - 18-06-2025
The module has been completely rewritten, so new bugs are to be expected.
Compatible with Foundry v13, use older versions for Foundry v12 (or earlier).

Additions:
* LibWrapper is now used to help prevent module incompatibilities
* User Config: Added 'Static' option to create users that don't change scenes when they're normally activated. The GM can control which scene is viewed by these users by right-clicking a scene in the scene navigation
* Set View dialog: Options are stored and recalled when re-opened
* Set View dialog: Added user selection
* Scene Config: Expanded options for when to hide UI elements
* Scene Config: Added option to hide the camera feed
* Module Settings: Added 'Right-Drag Viewbox Editing' option to enable or disable dragging the viewbox with the right mouse button
* Module Settings: Added 'Force GM-Set Settings' for the 'Physical Grid Size' which allows the GM to override all user configured grid size settings
* Module Settings: Added 'Pan Canvas to Ping Behavior' to allow panning through pings even when locks are applied
* Added 'Clone View' functionality, which will clone the current view to selected players. This can be done using the 'Set View' control button, the new 'Clone View' control button, or a configurable hotkey (C + Alt, by default). You can configure if this should clone the pan and/or the zoom, and which users this should apply to ('Enabled' users, by default) through the module settings or by right-clicking the 'Clone View' control button
* Control buttons:Added 'Reset View' control button that resets the view of users as if the scene was reloaded
* Module Settings: Added 'Control Button Configurator', which can be used to configure which (if any) Lock View control buttons are displayed

Removals:
* Removed 'Rotation' option from scene config because it was too buggy

Other:
* Switched all applications over to ApplicationV2
* Reoganized scene flags. Old scene flags are no longer used, existing flags should automatically migrate


### v1.5.9 - 11-10-2023
Fixes:

* Default scene config is now properly applied on new scenes
* Physical Gridsize can now be applied to all scenes when accessed through the 'Set View' control button
* When editing what UI elements to hide, other changes to scene settings are no longer reset


### v1.5.8 - 14-09-2023
Fixes:

* Default user settings are no longer applied to GM users
* Removed debug message that would occasionally spam the console


### v1.5.7 - 14-06-2023
Fixes:

* Forgot to add the css folder to the release, preventing the module from functioning.


### v1.5.6 - 14-06-2023
Additions:

* Added a scene configurator to allow easy configuration of the Lock View settings, including copying settings from one scene to another and configuring the default configuration for new scenes. Accessible through a button in the scene configuration and the module settings
* Added default user settings which are applied to new or unconfigured users. By default this enables 'Enable' and 'Viewbox'
* Canvas can now be rotated from the Lock View menu in the Scene Configuration and using the 'Set View' dialog (thanks to Dylancyclone)


Fixes:

* Fixed 'hide control button' not hiding the control button in all cases
* Fixed error that would pop up when 'hide control button' was enabled and the scene configuration was closed
* Hiding UI elements now only sets the element to invisible, preventing other elements from shifting around


Other:

* Made compatible with Foundry V11, dropped compatibility with V9
* Changed 'Collapse Sidebar on Scene Load' to 'Sidebar on Scene Load' and made it a selection between 'No Change', 'Collapse' and 'Expand'


### v1.5.4 - 14-09-2022
Fixes:

* Fixed error related to canvas.blur, which prevented the canvas from loading in certain situations
* Fixed errors and warnings when boundingbox was active while panlock was not, and a controlled token moved outside the view (which should cause the canvas to pan automatically)
* Fixed compatibility warnings when editing drawings (for bounding box purposes)


### v1.5.3 - 31-08-2022

Additions:

* Added the option for players to control the module through control buttons. This can be enabled in the user configuration with the 'control' setting
* When using the 'Edit Viewbox' functionality, zooming and panning will only be affected when you hover your mouse over the user's viewbox (it used to affect all users)
* Added the UI (un)hide hotkey to the core keybinding menu. Defaults to Alt + U


Other:

* Improved the documentation and naming of things (mainly related to the user config). Please not that the old 'control' setting is renamed to 'enable'
* Made compatible with Foundry v10, dropped compatibility with Foundry v8


### v1.5.2 - 22-03-2022
Fixes:

* Previous update broke the User Configuration if a user had not been configured before


### v1.5.1 - 22-03-2022
Fixes:

* Fixed issue where zoom and pan lock would sometimes not be applied on scene load
* Fixed issue where switching from a scene with UI elements hidden to a scene with 'Hide UI Elements on Sidebar Collapse' disabled would not always show all UI elements
* Fixed issue where in the User Configuration, if an override was enabled, it also showed the setting as enabled for individual users


Additions:

* Added 'Hide Control Button' setting in the module settings


### v1.5.0 - 30-12-2021
Fixes:

* View no longer resets to the 'Autoscale' setting after interacting with the sidebar
* Fixed console error when the Stream View module was enabled


Additions:

* User Configuration now has a user role specific override. To, for example, enable control for all Trusted Players


Other:

* Made compatible with Foundry v9
* Dropped compatibility with Foundry v0.7


### v1.4.14 - 01-09-2021
Fixes:

* In the last update, 'Hide UI Elements on Sidebar Collapse' accedentally allowed the GM to hide the sidebar (this could lock the GM out of controlling the software), this has been fixed



* Added the 'Ctrl+u' hotkey that can be used to hide/unhide the UI elements that have been configured in the scene config


### v1.4.13 - 30-08-2021
Fixes:

* If 'Hide UI Elements was enabled', control buttons would not always hide if a scene was changed
* UI elements will now only be unhidden if they have been previously hidden by Lock View, allowing other modules to hide/unhide UI elements without Lock View interfering
* Lock View would cause the view to 'bounce' when combined with 'Always Centered'. This has been fixed.
* When configuring the initial view, dragging the box around could place tokens or templates, depending on what tool was selected, this has been fixed by automatically selecting the Lock View control


### v1.4.12 - 22-06-2021
Fixes:

* A change in the previous update made the module incompatible with Foundry 0.7, this has been fixed.


### v1.4.11 - 21-06-2021
Fixes:

* If 'Control' was enabled for the GM, and the sidebar was set to autohide, the GM would be locked out of all controls, essentially bricking the world until Lock View was disabled. To fix this, the sidebar can never be hidden for the GM
* Canvas layers were registered incorrectly, leading to module incompatibilities. This has been fixed thanks to SWW13 on Github


Other:

* Confirmed compatibility with Foundry 0.8.7


### v1.4.10 - 31-05-2021
Fixes:

* Removed some console errors about the canvas not being initialized

### v1.4.9 - 14-05-2021
Fixes:

* Autoscaling using Physical Gridsize was broken
* 'Set Initial View' configuration wouldn't work if no initial view position was configured previously
* In the scene config, fixed the hint for 'Force Initial View'. It didn't state that it also works if autoscale is set to 'Physical Gridsize', and added description of the button
* If 'Hide UI on Sidebar Collapse' was on, scene navigation would still be displayed after the GM switched a Lock View function on or off
* Various actions, such as starting combat, would reset the view to the initial view position, if 'Force Initial View' was enabled
* Changes to the scene configuration would not automatically update the control button states


Additions:

* In the 'Set Initial View' configuration, added the option to set the view to the current view of a connected player

Additions:
