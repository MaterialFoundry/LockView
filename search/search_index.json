So on displays with a different resolution, or different 'virtual' resolution (due to things like display scaling), more or less of the scene will be visible. </p> <p>What exactly is the Initial View Position? The initial view position is a combination of 3 values:</p> <ul> <li>X-coordinate</li> <li>Y-coordinate</li> <li>Scale (sometimes called zoom)</li> </ul> <p>The X and Y-coordinates describe the center point of the view, which will be the same for everyone. The scale describes how many pixels of the scene (or background image) correspond with 1 pixel on your display.</p> <p>A scale of 1 means that 1 pixel of the scene will correspond with 1 pixel on your display. So if you have a 1080p (1920x1080) display, 1920 pixels of the scene will be displayed horizontally. A scale of 2 means that 2 pixels of the scene will correspond with 1 pixel on your display. So only 960 pixels of the scene will be displayed horizontally, so the scene is essentially zoomed in by a factor of 2.</p> <p>What does this mean in practise? This means that multiple things will influence how much of the scene will be visible at a specific scale:</p> <ul> <li>Display Resolution: If you double the display resolution, twice as much of the scene will be visible. In other words: the scene will be zoomed in half as much.</li> <li>Display Aspect Ratio: Most modern displays have an aspect ratio of 16:9 or 16:10 (e.g. 1920x1080 and 1920x1200, respectively). This means that, if the horizontal resolution is the same, the amount of the scene that's displayed in the vertical direction will be different.</li> <li>Display Scaling: In the display settings of your operating system, you will be able to set a display scaling value, usually expressed in a percentage. 100% means that everything is displayed at the actual resolution of the display, 200% means that everything will be displayed twice as big. This means that, as far as your browser/Foundry is concerned, the resolution of your display is halved. So for a 1920x1080 display, the browser/Foundry will think it's a 960x540 display (if set to 200% scaling). This will have the same effect as having a display with a different resolution, as described above.</li> <li>Browser Zoom: Browsers, such as Chrome or Firefox allow you to zoom in on a web page (in the menu at the top-right of the browser, 3 dots for Chrome, 3 horizontal lines for Firefox). The effect of this is exactly the same as display scaling, see above.</li> </ul> <p>What to do about it? First of all, you'll need to accept that it might not be possible for everyone to see exactly the same thing using a specific initial view position. If you want a more reliable way to make sure everyone sees the (almost) the same thing, consider using one of the autoscaling options in the scene config.</p> <p>There are some things you and your players can do:</p> <ul> <li>If everyone has the same display resolution, make sure everyone uses the same display scaling and browser zoom level.</li> <li>If someone has a higher resolution display, ask them to set display scaling or their browser's zoom level to a value so their 'virtual' resolution is closer to the display resolution of other players (e.g. if they have a 4k display and you have a 1080p display, ask them to set the zoom level to 200%).</li> </ul> <p>Getting a perfect initial view position for a specific user If you only care about the initial view position of a specific user, for example, when you have a TV table and you want to make sure the initial view is correct on the TV, you can do the following:</p> <ol> <li>Hook everything up as you would for a normal game</li> <li>Load the scene you want to configure</li> <li>Position the view on the TV the way you want the initial view position to be</li> <li>Go into the Lock View tab of the scene config and press the 'Configure Initial View' button in the 'Force Initial View' section</li> <li>In the new window, at 'Set to Player View' you select the TV player</li> <li>Press 'Capture View' and then 'Save Changes'</li> </ol> Autoscaling and the Initial View Position <p>If autoscaling is configured in the scene config, some or all of the initial view position will be overridden. For 'Physical Grid Size', only the X and Y position of the initial view position will take effect. For all other autoscale options the initial view position will not do anything.</p> Bounding Box and the Initial View Position <p>With the 'Bounding Box' lock, you can force the view of users to stay within a specified area. If the initial view position would cause the view to be outside of that area, the view will be changed so it fits inside of the area.</p>"},{"location":"sceneConfig/initialView/#initial-view-configurator","title":"Initial View Configurator","text":""},{"location":"sceneConfig/locks/","title":"Locks","text":"<p>Work in progress, refer to the old documentation.</p>"},{"location":"sceneConfig/sceneConfig/","title":"Scene Config","text":"<p>A new Lock View tab has been added to the scene configuration.
